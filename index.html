        The Jaunpur Sultanate attained its greatest height under the younger brother of Mubarak Shah,
        who ruled as Shams-ud-din Ibrahim Shah (ruled 1402-1440).
        To the east, his kingdom extended to Bihar, and to the west,
        to Kanauj; he even marched on Delhi at one point. Under the aegis of a Muslim holy man named Qutb al-Alam, he threatened the Sultanate of Bengal under Raja Ganesha.[6]

During the reign of Husain Shah (1456â€“76), the Jaunpur army was perhaps the biggest in India, and Husain decided to attempt a conquest of Delhi. However, he was defeated on three successive attempts by Bahlul Khan Lodi. It is a dominant trend in modern historiography of the period that this defeat was a cause of a large number of eunuchs in the military ranks. Finally, under Sikandar Lodi, the Delhi Sultante was able to reconquer Jaunpur in 1493, bringing that sultanate to an end.
